<!-- compile ts to use on render.com -->
npm run build

## Overview

### Usage / Idea

### Challenges

#### Issues:
##### Task server site

(1) User selects courseInfo with input "course = 'GCK'" and "round = 'half'/'full' " Â» id is set by db on default
(2) User input into agapsTable with inputs like 'hole', 'roundId'


##### Task client site
- client :
(1) when User selects 'half' end round after 9 holes, 'full' after 18
(3) binding courseInfo and agapsTable -- matching roundId to id of courseInfo

(4) take id of courseInfo slected, and set it equal to roundId 
    --> passing state with useNavigate to certain Components like: HoleCardStart.tsx and InputFields.tsx
 ```js
 ///  useNavigate
    navigate("/hole-card/1", { state: newPostObj.roundId })
 ```
(5) when User:
    -- is in round and ends round before finishing 'half' or 'full' by leaving window
        -- send message to User: "Do you really want to finish round here?"
        -- let User continue where left
        -- make use of sessionStorage?
